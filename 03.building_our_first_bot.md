# Building our first bot

Alright, so now we have created a Slack application which we can use to connect
to our workspace. But, how do we do that?

## Reading the documentation

One of the reasons I chose Python for this talk is because it has a great [Slack
client](https://github.com/slackapi/python-slackclient). This is great
because it ensures that you don't need to think about connections and processing
of the underlying events. Instead of reading the Slack API reference (only) we
can put or primary focus on the [python library
documentation](https://slack.dev/python-slackclient/).

## Just connecting

So we just want to connect and ensure that our bot can read all our messages.
This is super simple!

```python
import os
import time

from slackclient import SlackClient

ACCESS_TOKEN = os.environ.get("SLACK_API_TOKEN")

def main():
    client = SlackClient(ACCESS_TOKEN)

    while True:
        for data in client.rtm_read():
            print(data)

        time.sleep(1)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

We're now ready to create features and functions for this bot to act upon!
