# Before you code

If you've got an idea of what you want to build or if you're eager to learn new
things it's easy to just start writing your code. However, history has shown
that if you use tools that analyze your code as you write it it will help both
you and potential other developers in the future.

I know that this sounds like boring things but I wanted to note this because all
code in this project is using some of those helping tools.

## Editor

So there's like a million editors and IDEs you can you to format your code and
always chose one that feels good for you. I would however recommend an editor
that can help you to analyze and format your code as you write.

This project is written with [neovim](https://neovim.io/) using [vim
plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) as a plugin manager. The plugins
used are [ale](https://github.com/w0rp/ale) which is a tool to lint and fix your
code as you write. The code formatter itself used is
[black](https://github.com/ambv/black) which is one of the most popular python
formatting utils. The linters I used is
[flake8](http://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/) and
[pylint](https://www.pylint.org/) because why not obey as many best practices as
possible?

With all this installed, this is the configuration I use:

```vim
" Run all fixes and formatting whenever you save.
let g:ale_fix_on_save = 1

" Use custom non-default options for black.
let g:ale_python_black_options = '--line-length 79'

" Use black as python fixer and use builtin fixers for all code.
let g:ale_fixers = {
\   '*': ['remove_trailing_lines', 'trim_whitespace'],
\   'python': ['black'],
\}

" Use pylint and flake8 as linting tols which will warn you about common
" formatting mistakes.
let g:ale_linters = {
\   'python': ['flake8', 'pylint'],
\}
```

**But I say this again**, you don't need to do all this, it's just my experience
that tells me I will thank myself in the future if I do this.
